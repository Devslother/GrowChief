  GrowChief is composed of 3 main services and 2 external services - all 5 of
  the main services typically run within a single docker container, and talk to
  each other through HTTP. Those 4 main servers typically talk to other
  containers, running the external services - the SQL Database, Redis Queue and
  Storage.

<H2>Architecture Overview</H2>
<Divider />

<P>
  Before getting started with development, have a good read of the [architecture
  overview.](/docs/how-it-works) This will give you a good understanding of how
  the project is structured and how the different parts of the project interact
  with each other.
</P>

<H2>Repository Overview</H2>
<Divider />

<P>
  GrowChief is an open-source project, and the source code is available on
  [GitHub.](https://github.com/gitroomhq/growchief-app)
</P>

<P>
  The project is generally built using scripts in the package.json file with
  npm. The main scripts are:
</P>

<List>
  <Item>npm run dev - Starts the development server</Item>
  <Item>npm run prisma-generate - Generates the Prisma client</Item>
  <Item>
    npm run prisma-db-push - Pushes the database schema to the database
  </Item>
</List>

<P>
  The entire project is built under [NX](https://nx.dev/) to have a monorepo
  with multiple projects.
</P>

<P>
  Unlike other NX project, this project has one .env file that is shared between
  all the apps. It makes it easier to develop and deploy the project.
</P>

<H3>Frontend</H3>
<P>
  The frontend is built with React Router and
  [TailwindCSS.](https://tailwindcss.com/)
</P>

<H3>Backend</H3>
<P>
  The backend is built with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) with a basic
  architecture of controllers, services, repositories and dtos.
</P>

<P>
  It uses [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) as an ORM to interact with the
  database. By default Prisma uses [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) as a
  database, but it can be easily changed to any other database since there are
  no native queries.
</P>

<P>It uses Redis to schedule posts and run background jobs.</P>

<H3>Cron</H3>
<P>
  cron is built with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) and share components with the
  backend.
</P>

<H3>Worker</H3>
<P>
  worker is built with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) and share components with
  the backend.
</P>

<H2>Contributors Guide</H2>
<Divider />
<P>

  contained in the main repository. It provides information on how to contribute
  to the project, mainly the format for how to submit a pull request.
</P>

# GrowChief

GrowChief is a production-ready web platform built as a personal portfolio project.

The entire frontend was independently implemented from Figma designs,
with a strong focus on responsive layouts, UI consistency,
and real-world frontend patterns using the Next.js App Router.

## Preview

Live demo: https://my-react-grow.netlify.app/

- Responsive layout (desktop & mobile)
- Documentation and blog powered by MDX
- App Router navigation and layouts
- SEO-friendly pages and metadata

## My Role

Frontend Developer (Junior-level)

- Independently implemented the entire frontend based on Figma designs
- Translated UI designs into responsive and accessible React components
- Built reusable layout and UI patterns using the Next.js App Router
- Implemented blog and documentation systems using MDX

- Focused on clean structure, maintainability, and real-world UX details

## Key Engineering Challenges

### Scalable App Router Architecture

- Implemented complex gradient-based UI effects
- Ensured consistency across multiple sections and content types
